    "\n",
    "This is an introduction to the Python programming language with a focus on the concepts you'll need to know for Media Automation. You should be already familiar with many of these ideas - such as loops and function definitions - from your experience in R, SAS, SPSS, or other statistical programming languages, so this session will serve to extend your knowledge to the Python syntax.\n",
